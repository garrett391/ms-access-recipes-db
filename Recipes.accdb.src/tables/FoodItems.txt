51	Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders	Trader Joes	4 oz (113g)	24	2	150	One of the many reasons we love the pre-marinated options in our fresh meat section is their utter simplicity of preparation. With all the chopping, slicing, and seasoning done for you, all that separates you from a juicy, flavorful, center-of-the-plate protein is a few minutes of grilling, roasting, or sautéeing. Take Trader Joe’s Sun- Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders, which are making their grand comeback to our refrigerators, for instance. Made with a base of boneless, skinless Chicken Breast tenders and a creamy, savory, Mediterranean- style marinade, prepping this dish from scratch would normally be a labor-intensive endeavor. But since all the work is done for you, you’re free to focus on the finer details, like what kind of side to serve alongside them—or what kind of wine...\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, we find the tart and tangy notes of the Sun-Dried Tomato, along with the bright aromatics of the Basil, garlic, and onion make this is an ideal protein to pair with pasta, roasted veggies, and a dry, yet fruity, red wine. For something a little different, try pan-frying these Tenders and placing them in a sandwich with Pesto and slices of Fresh Mozzarella.	https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/sun-dried-tomato-basil-chicken-tenders-098648	
52	Tomato Basil Boursin Protien Penne Pasta	G&C		59.18	0	1552.05		https://www.instagram.com/p/DAJmjfLJe7k/	1. Preheat oven to 400 F and set rack to middle position. Place the Boursin in the center of your ceramic baking pan. Add your baby tomatoes followed by your crushed garlic. Drizzle your olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the fresh chives and basil (alternatively, you can add the fresh herbs after baking). Bake at 400 F for 30-35 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. When your tomatoes and Boursin are almost done baking, prepare your pasta according to the instructions on the packaging.\r\n\r\n3. After you have finished baking your tomatoes and Boursin, use a meat masher or fork to break the tomatoes and Boursin apart. Add in your fresh spinach and mix until everything is well combined. Add in your drained and cooked tortellini. Mix again until the tortellini is covered in Boursin and everything is well combined! Enjoy!
53	Chicken Chorizo Breakfast Burrito	Red's	1 Burrito (142g)	16	1	340	Our signature chicken chorizo breakfast sausage is perfectly seasoned with paprika and rosemary and paired with fluffy, cage-free scrambled eggs, plus a rich blend of delicious white cheddar, pepper jack, and mozzarella cheese — wrapped in a freshly baked tortilla.

56	Dark Chocolate Covered Mini Pretzels	Trader Joes	5 pretzels (28g)	2	9	140	Some would say that combining sweet & salty produces a sum greater than its parts. We could knot agree more, especially when you’re talking about Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Covered Pretzels!\r\n\r\nSalted Mini Pretzels (not to be confused with “Tiny” pretzels, which are even smaller) are expertly coated with premium Dark Chocolate that is 49% cocoa solids. The thick Chocolate coating is bittersweet & rich, giving way to the superb and slightly salty crunch of the Pretzel\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\nTrader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Covered Pretzels are easily a standalone snack, but we also recommend you mix them in a bowl with TJ’s Candy Coated Milk Chocolate Dipped Peanuts and watch the sweet & salty snackers flock. Or, crumble them over your favorite Trader Joe’s Ice Cream for an added textural treat. You’ll find these Dark Chocolate Covered Pretzels every day in our stores, alongside their milky counterpart.	https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/dark-chocolate-covered-mini-pretzels-045141
