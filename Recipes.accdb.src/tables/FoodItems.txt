51	Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders	Trader Joes	4 oz (113g)	24	2	150	One of the many reasons we love the pre-marinated options in our fresh meat section is their utter simplicity of preparation. With all the chopping, slicing, and seasoning done for you, all that separates you from a juicy, flavorful, center-of-the-plate protein is a few minutes of grilling, roasting, or sautéeing. Take Trader Joe’s Sun- Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders, which are making their grand comeback to our refrigerators, for instance. Made with a base of boneless, skinless Chicken Breast tenders and a creamy, savory, Mediterranean- style marinade, prepping this dish from scratch would normally be a labor-intensive endeavor. But since all the work is done for you, you’re free to focus on the finer details, like what kind of side to serve alongside them—or what kind of wine...\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, we find the tart and tangy notes of the Sun-Dried Tomato, along with the bright aromatics of the Basil, garlic, and onion make this is an ideal protein to pair with pasta, roasted veggies, and a dry, yet fruity, red wine. For something a little different, try pan-frying these Tenders and placing them in a sandwich with Pesto and slices of Fresh Mozzarella.	https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/sun-dried-tomato-basil-chicken-tenders-098648
