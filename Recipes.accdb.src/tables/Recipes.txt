Drizzle your olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the fresh chives and basil (alternatively, you can add the fresh herbs after baking). Bake at 400 F for 30-35 minutes.\r\n2. When your tomatoes and Boursin are almost done baking, prepare your tortellini according to the instructions on the packaging.\r\n3. After you have finished baking your tomatoes and Boursin, use a meat masher or fork to break the tomatoes and Boursin apart. Add in your fresh spinach and mix until everything is well combined. Add in your drained and cooked tortellini. Mix again until the tortellini is covered in Boursin and everything is well combined! Enjoy!
